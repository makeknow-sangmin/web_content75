Thanks for your downloading the Bryntum Kanban Task Board!

The Bryntum Task Board is a very flexible JavaScript work management tool built on the Ext JS framework (made by Sencha Inc).
It will help you visualize the work items your team deals with on a daily basis. It is very easy to setup
and customize according to your business needs and you can style each individual task element in the chart by using just simple CSS.
 
Note: To view the examples you need to run them in a web server context, since they use Ajax to load the chart data.
If you are new to Sencha Touch or if you want to improve your existing skills, we also offer an introduction course that covers the most
important aspects of the platform. For more information please visit http://www.bryntum.com/training/.
