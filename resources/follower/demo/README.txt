/*
* PHP Gantt Demo
* Bryntum AB Â©2012
*/

This is a demo showing our ExtGantt component running with a PHP backend. It's a modified `advanced` example, that offers similar functionality with added resources assignment.

Requirements for this example :
- WebServer (Apache or similar)
- PHP 5+
- MySQL 5+

The first step is to set the database tables. It can be easily done utilising the sql file included with the demo. After running
the file in the SQL manager of your choice (like phpMyAdmin) we need to set the DB parameters in `template.php` file.Change host, username, password and database name to correct values.

These steps should give us a working demo when running `php_demo.php` on your server.
